DriveTrain; each side ran by 2x Neo's  w/ spark max's at around 13:1 ratio.

Cargo Scoring Mech; 
    Lift arm is driven by 1x Neo linked to a 16:1 gearbox and a further sprocket reduction with a total reduction of around 30:1. 
    Intake is driven by a 775 pro with a 4:1 reduction linked to a regular spark. 
Hook Arm
    Shoulder is driven by a Neo with a 40:1 reduction through a versaplanetary gearbox.
    Winch is driven by a Neo with a 16:1 gearbox.
Claw
    a Neo with a 40:1 reduction through a versaplanetary gearbox.
    We have a limit switch mounted but not wired which should give us confirmation when claw has grabbed the bar.
